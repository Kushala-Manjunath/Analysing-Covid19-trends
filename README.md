# Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Students' Behavior and Well-being

## Overview

This repository contains the code, analysis, and findings from our research study examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student behaviors and well-being. Using data from 1,182 student responses, we investigated the complex interrelationships between time allocation patterns, digital behaviors, and health outcomes during lockdown periods.

## Key Research Areas

•	Time allocation patterns across activities (online classes, self-study, sleep, fitness, social media)
•	Impact of different online learning platforms on student experiences
•	Relationship between digital behaviors and health outcomes
•	Regional and demographic variations in student responses to remote learning

## Methodology

The study employed multiple statistical approaches to analyze the survey data:
•	Chi-square tests for associations between categorical variables
•	ANOVA for comparing means across groups
•	Logistic regression for predicting health outcomes
•	Correlation analysis for relationships between time allocation variables
•	Ordinal regression for analyzing online learning experience factors

## Key Findings

Health and Time Allocation
•	Physical activity emerged as a critical protective factor for student health
•	Students without health issues spent significantly more time on fitness activities
•	Sleep duration and fitness time were negatively associated with reported health issues

Weight Change Dynamics
•	Statistically significant association between weight change and health status
•	Students reporting decreased weight spent more time on fitness activities
•	Social media usage was highest among students with increased weight

Online Learning Experience
•	Medium used for online classes significantly affected satisfaction levels
•	Tablet users reported higher engagement levels than smartphone or laptop users
•	Self-study time and sleep duration were positive predictors of learning satisfaction
•	Optimal satisfaction occurred with moderate time allocation (4-6 hours)

Digital Media Usage
•	Strong platform preference concentration (Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube)
•	Significant negative correlation between self-study and social media time
•	Minimal regional differences in social media usage patterns
